The longest lasting \"writing\" we have today was carved by ancient people's all over the world into rocks. Rocks last way longer than computer memory (computer memory lasts only 10s of years!) I read a [paper](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/~archer/deep_earth_readings/sleep.2006.archean_weat.pdf) and found that over a million years quartz (on Earth) could weather as little as 4 meters every million years from water. We need our carvings to last a billion years, so assuming our carving was exposed that entire time we would need to carve at least 4 kilometers deep. That's pretty deep, and it would be pretty hard to find a layer of rock that is pure quartz 4 kilometers deep, but it's one (pretty absurd) option. If we could stop the quartz from getting rained on it would be visible practically indefinitely, so carving quartz on the Moon would be a much better choice as we'd only need to carve deep enough for shadows to be visible from far away, which is on the order of meters and not kilometers.**\n",

With enough mass or mastery of crazy magnetic fields we could do something similar artificially altering the wobbles of pulsars.**\n",

A quantitative estimate for any of those kinds of answers is just how long (astrophysically) those kinds of objects should last and thus your message will be visible. For the \"carving onto rocks\" option you would need to likely somehow carve on a lot of rocks (across the galaxy, i.e. with some kind of robots that could survive such a journey). For the time bending option you would likewise need to somehow send your messages in a bottle to a lot of places or have them blasting out continuous electromagnetic (i.e. radio) messages at a very high (you can and should calculate how high based on relativistic effects) frequency.

The longest such timescale would be for aliens \"broadcasting\" their messages to us &mdash; since we invented radio telescopes in the 50s and 60s the time period we could have \"detected\" aliens broadcasting is roughly 50 years.
