This is where the famous \"twin paradox\" arises from: the twin in the spaceship will observe the Earth to be moving at a constant speed while the twin on Earth will observe the spaceship to be the thing that is moving, thus won't they disagree about who ends up older? \n",

    "\n",
    "**Solution: Lots of reasonable answers here, but all should lay out that, in general, a Minkowski diagram is a graphical way of representing spacetime for an observer at a certain velocity. Usually they are 2D, with the x axis corresponding to distance (usually in ly) and the y axis corresponding to \"time distance\" ($ct$, usually also in units of ly). Different observers get different scaling on their axes as their spacetime is warped by special relativistic effects, but all observers agree that light rays have a slope with an absolute value of 1 because light travels 1 light year every year. Lines of simultaneity are determined by where lines parallel to an observer's x axis impact their time axis.** \n",

In doing so their lines of simultaneity change, and on landing back at Earth they both agree on how long the journey took as their lines of simultaneity converge. What the graphic shows is that, prior to turning around, the twin on the spaceship thinks only a few years have passed. As they turn around and change reference frames, however, they skip over a bunch of Earth time, thus as they turn around they would see many years pass on Earth in an instant. The twin on Earth experiences all this time normally, so when they meet up again the twin on Earth is older than the twin in the spaceship as the twin in the spaceship essentially skipped a bunch of years when they turned around.**"

The slopes of the lines of simultaneity on the outbound portion of the trip will be $v/c = 2/3$ and on the return trip to the rebel base they will be $-v/c = -2/3$. Just like in the answer to the twin paradox above, the age discrepancy happens when Han Solo turns around and his lines of simultaneity skip over a bunch of rebel time.**\n",
