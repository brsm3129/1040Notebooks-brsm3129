    "## 2 The Cosmic Microwave Background [50 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "The big bang theory predicts that background light was freely emitted as black-body radiation when the universe cooled to around 3,000 K 380,000 years after its beginning. Why did the universe have to wait this long? In the beginning the big bang predicts that the universe would be filled with a very hot and dense soup of subatomic particle plasma, which was opaque to light (optically thick). As the universe expanded it cooled, and eventually reached a tipping point after a few hundred thousand years where it was cool enough that the first atoms (mostly H) could form &mdash; these atoms were basically transparent when compared with the earlier subatomic plasma soup, so all of the light that was bouncing around in the early universe was let out in an instant, to freely travel across cosmic time and space. Because space has expanded a great deal since the big bang this radiation has been redshifted into the microwave portion of the EM spectrum, hence we call it the cosmic *microwave* background (CMB). Because it was emitted at the moment the universe became mostly transparent, this radiation marks the farthest back in time and space we can possibly see. The big bang theory predicted the properties of the cosmic microwave background before it was observed, thus its observation is one of the fundamental underpinnings of this theory and why we think it is the best explanation for how our universe was formed. \n",

    "### a) What color was the early universe? [10 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the fact that the big bang theory predicts that the light should have been emitted as a blackbody when the universe was roughly 3,000 K to calculate the peak wavelength of emission. Suppose you wanted to paint your room the color of the early universe &mdash; what might you choose and why? \n",
    "\n",
    "### b) What color is the universe today? [10 points]\n",
    "Use the spectrum of the CMB produced by the FIRAS team (shown below, or at [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#/media/File:Cmbr.svg) link) to calculate the peak wavelength of the observed CMB emission today. Is any of the emission from the early universe still visible to the human eye today? \n",
    "\n",
    "### c) What is the temperature of the universe? [10 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your answer from part b, calculate the temperature of the present-day cosmic background. Since the CMB permeates all of space, this is essentially the minimum temperature of anything embedded in space. \n",
    "\n",
    "### d) What is the redshift of the CMB? [10 points]\n",
    "Using your answers from parts a and b, calculate the redshift of the cosmic background. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint: remember that redshift is a dimensionless number, and since the CMB looks far back in space/time this should be a large number.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### e) Evidence for a big bang [10 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare your answer in part d to the redshifts of the farthest observable galaxies &mdash; is it safe to say the CMB is the farthest observed point in the universe's history? In your own words, why does this measurement support the big bang theory? \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We can't use Hubble's law to calculate the age of the universe (Hubble's law is really only valid for z < a few) but more careful treatment reveals that this redshift is consistent with the light originally having been emitted roughly 300-400 thousand years after the big bang. "
